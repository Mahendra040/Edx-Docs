3. cms/djnagoapps/contentstore/courseware_index.py
--- this file used to put data on price filed which added in course_card.js file
--- In index_about_information method get price from CourseMode class with min_course_price_for_currencymethod and pass two arguments course key and currency symbol and store on varibale price. Pass this price variable in course_info dictionary
--- reindex course from studio to apply changes

)


4. cms/envs/common.py
--- We uses currency sumbol to get price in index_about_information() method. currency symbol is not in cms/common.py. So place that varibale in this file
