solved this issue with creating link to true location of .csv files(/tmp/edx-s3/grades) in /edx/var/edxapp/media directory

run this command in edxuser:
ln -s /tmp/edx-s3/grades /edx/var/edxapp/media

and then make little changes in nginx configuration.

nano /edx/app/nginx/sites-available/lms

add following rule:

location ~ ^/grades/(?P<file>.*) {
    root /edx/var/edxapp/media/grades;
    try_files /$file =404;
    expires 31536000s;
}

Edit location rule for media, tall to search in /grades if there is no such file in /media

location ~ ^/media/(?P<file>.*) {
    root /edx/var/edxapp/media;
    try_files /$file /grades/$file;
    expires 31536000s;
}

and then restart nginx

service nginx restart

It should work ;-)
